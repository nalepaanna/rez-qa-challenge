This repository contains automated tests written in Cypress.io related to the site: https://www.rezfusionhubdemo.com/hub-test-vacation-rentals

Tests are splitted into two tests suites, each for one of the user stories:

- As a user I want the ability to save properties Iâ€™m looking at so they can be reviewed at a later time:
  properties.cy.ts

  filters.cy.ts

## Requirements

- Node.js are installed to your local system. Install at least v18.12.0 or higher. https://nodejs.org/en/
- Visual Studio Code is the preferred IDE. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
